				<h1>Hi. I'm <span>Tanzina Toma</span>. </h1>
				<img src="images/me.png">
				<p>
					I am currently persuing a degree on Computer Science and Engineering in BRAC University.
					By the grace of God I have always maintained my education with a high distinction. I completed both of my Secondary and Higher Secondary Certificate Holy Cross School and College in Bangladesh. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In my university life I have tried to maintain my enthusiasm towards my education which has lead me to the Programming Language Instructor of BRAC University Residential Campus.
					I have been selected as Student Tutor for three times by my department of Data Structure course.
					I prefer being self-independent and that is why I try to carry my own expense. I have been tutoring for the past 4 years. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Although I lead a very busy life, I manage to steal some time for my own. I like to read lots of books. I am an introvert person and I find my happiness in books. My other hobbies are listening to music, watching movies & tv-series. 
        		</p>
        		<p>
					I am a perfectionist who likes to have everything in a perfect order. That is why I want my career to start in a perfect way. Skills are mandatory ingredient to work my way towards a perfect career. So, I always find it to be of great importantance to achieve skills in the technical sectors. I participated in many programming contests and workshops, seminars based on technical subjecs. Being in a field like CSE that requires good technical skills in any of the sides it has, I got interested in Web Development. The interested first started while building a website as a class assignment and has grown ever since. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When I was thinking about my future after graduation in this field and then I learned about the online full stack web development course of "Shikhbe Shobai" from one of my friend.
					I hope to learn all the necessery tools needed to establish myself as a web developer. This course has been really interesting from the beginning and I hope this will help me learn lots of life skills needed to move forward.
